My Advent of Code 2018-2019 programs

_Note: I simply took a swing at each puzzle and worked it till I got the answer, with no further tweaking or refactoring._

_Clearly, in some (many?) cases, I am not going for performance optimization._

_So... these are not necessarily the best solutions, but they are mine, and they are correct._
